### Accomplishments & Achievements

I have spent more than a decade amassing knowledge and experience necessary to thrive in an agile world; since 2017, my primary focus has been in healthcare IT.

#### Technical Support

- Provided level two and greater technical support in a healthy variety of settings; mobile phones, school systems, computer repair, and healthcare.
- Obtained the CompTIA Network+ Certificate in 2016 to officiate my claims of being effectively self-driven and taught.
  - Disclaimer: this certificate will have expired by now due to changes in CompTIA's certification procedures, renewal requirements, and a lack of immediate relevancy in my current path.
- Architected workflows and procedures for supporting an emerging Electronic Health Record.
  - Worked adjacent to the activities of the health record implementation team, development teams, product teams, hospital management, and health IT professionals to implement the support desk in real time.
- Leading a team of two other technical consultants, I provided on-site and remote support at an ambulatory clinic consisting of approximately 10 health care providers of various disciplines.
  - Additionally supported the application in a specialist setting, outpatient clinic, and sister clinic.
  - Oversaw the technical implementation of the solution at a separate hospital system -- including configuration of interfaces using HL7 to communicate with laboratory, billing, and practice management systems.
- Employed knowledge of databases, a deep understanding of software, and a dose of curiosity to assist development teams by getting ahead of problems and often being the first line of support responsible for executing protocols to ensure uninterrupted patient care.
- Combined my technical and analytical nature with my ability to clearly explain complex configurations and gather information pertinent to product teams.
- Led daily triage meetings working with people from countless disciplines and hierarchies across the health information technology ecosystem.
- Gained familiarity with numerous programming languages and countless more frameworks which translated into an ability to not only confirm the existance of an issue, but to isolate it to the exact component or offensive line of code.
- Served as the support consultant on a patient safety board.

#### Software Engineering

A lifelong interest and hobby manifest itself in career form during implementation of support desk procedures. This was driven by the fast-paced nature of the environment and the absolute necessity of removing human error to the highest degree.

- Developed and received approval for various tools, all of which empowered the support desk to work autonomously and with minimal risk; this allowed critical developments to proceed unabated.
- Operated as the lead front-end engineer on projects related to ePrescribing, clinical tasking, and healthcare software certifications.
- Worked with a highly focused scrum team consisting of one other engineer, two quality assurance engineers of whom also provided clinical guidance to to the team, and one product manager. We had work in 15 weekly release cycles and 3 quarterly releases. Excluding quarterly release work, which included enhancements or features, we delivered a total of 120 bugfixes with a 98% success rate. This ultimately resulted in disbandment of the team as our purpose had been fulfilled.
- Provided mentorship, executed the duties of a Scrum master, played an active role in countless release ceremonies, and consistently sought for advice or input.
- Laid out the framework, unit testing, and clean code patterns for a library which allows the mobile team to share endless possibilities of domain and business logic between iOS and Android platforms. This can be extended to support MacOS and anything capable of running a JVM with minimal effort outside of creating the presentation layer.

### Briefing of Core Capabilities and Understandings

- Well versed in patient safety procedures and the requirements of HIPAA.
- Intimate understanding of software development processes and expectations
- If there was an event that had a widespread effect on everything electronic and you still need your local computer network subnetted, I could do it.
  - Disclaimer: it would be on paper and useless.

### Character Testimonies

#### Ryan Durham, Senior Manager of Development

> Jay was an invaluable resource on our team. He has an analytical and exploratory nature that he effectively applies to both business and technical problems. He continually takes the initiative to find solutions for problems we don't know we have yet. Beyond his technical acumen, his background in support prepared him with the communication skills and tact necessary to thrive in a fast paced agile world; collaborating with members of the team, product management, leadership, or directly with a customer - you name it - Jay could do it.

#### Christine Stetler, Implementations Architect

> Jay’s ability to analyze and mitigate complex technical issues is unparalleled. That ability alone makes him an incredibly valuable resource. However, when you couple that with his ability to understand, effectively mitigate and/or explain resolution all the way from the end user to keyboard to user interface to API/interface to code level and back again, you know you’re in the presence of someone valuable and extremely rare. I want Jay on any project I’m involved in and you should too.

#### Myra McIver, Expert Client Account Manager

> I have worked with Jacob Jerrell at Allscripts and he is absolutely great to work with. He possesses a lot of in depth technical expertise that helped solve many of my clients issues that occurred during implementation. He is also very willing to help both his teammates and clients understand the technical requirements for the implementation as well as going above and beyond to ensure that they are successful.
