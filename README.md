## Recommendations

Sourced from [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-jerrell89/). Some of them may have masked their names based on connection level, so I'm attempting to respect that. The titles listed were the titles they held when I worked with them and may have changed.

### Senior Manager of Development

> Jay was an invaluable resource on our team. He has an analytical and exploratory nature that he effectively applies to both business and technical problems. He continually takes the initiative to find solutions for problems we don't know we have yet. Beyond his technical acumen, his background in support prepared him with the communication skills and tact necessary to thrive in a fast paced agile world; collaborating with members of the team, product management, leadership, or directly with a customer - you name it - Jay could do it.

### Implementations Architect

> Jay’s ability to analyze and mitigate complex technical issues is unparalleled. That ability alone makes him an incredibly valuable resource. However, when you couple that with his ability to understand, effectively mitigate and/or explain resolution all the way from the end user to keyboard to user interface to API/interface to code level and back again, you know you’re in the presence of someone valuable and extremely rare. I want Jay on any project I’m involved in and you should too.

### Expert Client Account Manager

> I have worked with Jacob Jerrell at Allscripts and he is absolutely great to work with. He possesses a lot of in depth technical expertise that helped solve many of my clients issues that occurred during implementation. He is also very willing to help both his teammates and clients understand the technical requirements for the implementation as well as going above and beyond to ensure that they are successful.
